I'm Kade Dean, a third year student at the University of Arizona pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science. My journey into the world of technology began at a young age when I discovered my passion for computer science. At the age of 9, I built my first computer (with quite a bit of help from my ex-NASA network engineer grandpa). This experience ignited a spark within me and set me on the path towards a deeper understanding of the computational systems that heavily occupy our daily lives.

During the academic school year, I serve as the Head of Broadcasting & Software Development within the <a href='https://esports.arizona.edu/'>University of Arizona's Department of Esports</a>, where I apply my knowledge of computer science to operate and enhance systems that streamline our weekly broadcasts. All while developing <a href='/projects/'>tools</a> to aid the program, I also act as a media host, co-hosting weekly <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@uarizonaesports'>podcast episodes</a> regarding the current Esports climate and interviewing our student athletes. It's a thrilling opportunity that allows me to merge my academic studies with hands-on practical applications all while having quite a bit of fun. Being part of this dynamic environment has further fueled my passion for leveraging technology to create efficient and seamless experiences.

My academic pursuits at the University of Arizona continue to expand my horizons, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and their real-world applications. With each passing day, I aim to learn more, grow professionally, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

In essence, my journey in computer science began as a childhood fascination, and has blossomed into a driving force shaping my education and career aspirations. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and eager to make meaningful contributions to the field of technology.
