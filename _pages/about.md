I'm Kade Dean, a fourth year student at the University of Arizona pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science. My journey into the world of technology began at a young age when I discovered my passion for computer science. At the age of 9, I built my first computer (with quite a bit of help from my ex-NASA network engineer grandpa). This experience ignited a spark within me and set me on the path towards a deeper understanding of the computational systems that heavily occupy our daily lives.

Currently, I'm focused on completing my senior year and preparing for my next chapter in the tech industry. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on various <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> that have allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios. These experiences have strengthened my foundation in computer science and fueled my passion for creating efficient and innovative solutions.

My academic pursuits at the University of Arizona continue to expand my horizons, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and their real-world applications. With each passing day, I aim to learn more, grow professionally, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

In essence, my journey in computer science began as a childhood fascination, and has blossomed into a driving force shaping my education and career aspirations. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and eager to make meaningful contributions to the field of technology.
