This project aimed to create an easy way to store and update frequently used
data that is displayed on stream by using JavaFX and Scene Builder to
create a user-friendly GUI and interfaces with OBS through txt files that are
updated depending on user input. As a result, this tool has become an integral
part of almost every UArizona Esports broadcast.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
