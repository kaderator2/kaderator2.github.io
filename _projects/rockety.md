### Background

During the final months of my time at the University of Arizona's Esports Department, I realized I had to make the most of the time I had left. I had about 6 months until the program fully shut down (due to unfortunate budget cuts :/) and at the time I had no idea of the program's unfortunate fate. All of the (three) other members of the department knew that the program was in a state of limbo. Not knowing what was going to happen next, I started thinking of ideas of projects I could do to make the time count. 

My boss and I had always been in talks since I joined the team about Leveraging my programming skills to create a unique Esports stats program for our players to use. This idea came up many times but we never quite had the time of the facilities to execute on it. Since the program was in a state of limbo, we had to put a pause on our long term project ideas; leading me to have to brainstorm with my boss and find an idea that would allow me to hone my skills as a developer and contribute to the programs success.

The solution:
**Rockety!**

### Preparation

At this point in my escapades of web development, I had a decent knowledge of JavaScript and I also had a decent knowledge of how much I *didn't* like JavaScript. While I don't find it impossible to work with, I think its lack of a proper type system can lead to some really confusing issues in the development process. *However*, I did really like how fast development can be when using JavaScript. Since I had full control over this project, I wanted to make sure that I found the right tools for the job. I began searching around for Alternatives that I could use to get the best of both worlds. 

After a decent amount of research I landed on **TypeScript**. There was a little bit of a learning curve initially but I quickly got the hang of it by doing some smaller, more basic projects to start. Armed with my web development Knowledge from my past few projects leading up to this point, I landed on a tech stack of - **TypeScript** and **React** to power the frontend, **Node.js**/**Express** to handle the backend, and **MongoDB** to allow me to store complex game data thanks to its flexible schema.
